* Introduction

  Org Mode's not quite my fortÃ« so this may take a few attempts.
  Hopefully doing my configuration literate-style helps me read things through.
  Majority of this is for personal notes.

  #+begin_src shell
    git clone git@github.com:dchesser/.emacs.d.git
  #+end_src

  To modify the source-code, use =C-c '= (control-C, then apostrophe).

* Read This, Dave!

  Because your memory probably sucks, dude, you might want to read
  over these questions in case you decide to change a custom value.

** Looking to change the font?

  Look in =early-init.el= and check out the following properties:

*** =D-preferred-fonts-list=

  This is a /list of strings/ of font face names in order of
  preference.  When initializing Emacs, a few sanity checks are made
  first to see whether that font is installed.

**** Details

  If =D-font-installed-p= returns non-nil, that font is good to go.
  =D-available-preferred-font= returns the name of the first available
  font and defaults to "Monospace" if none of them are installed.
  
*** =D-preferred-font-size=

  Needless to say, it's the size of the font.
  It is tacked on the end of the font descriptor string when it is
  generated for the initial frame.
